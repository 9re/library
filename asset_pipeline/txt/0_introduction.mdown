### Introduction

One of the coolest new features in Rails 3.1 is the way that it handles
static assets. This new chunk of hotness is called the "asset pipeline,"
and it is a much needed and welcome change from the way things were
before. This short little eBook will walk you through what this means
for your new greenfield Rails apps, how to upgrade apps from Rails 3.0,
and even how to implement this functionality in Sinatra.

Go forth and shove all your assets into /public no more.
